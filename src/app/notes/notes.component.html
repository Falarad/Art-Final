<h3>Show Notes</h3>
<p>
Thanks to collaboration from the “Estamos Unidos” organization and “Just One Opportunity” foundation, we were able to create two floats for the Independence Day parade. This exhibition will feature Neil Diamond’s hit song ‘America’. The focus of this is to open the eyes of the public of unfair immigration policies in place and support immigration reform to further benefit immigrants in a fair manner.
<br><br>
To paint you a picture, we will have the first float will showcase the United States of America with three immigrants outside of the border, each with a future year of when they might be eligible to enter the country. The years range from 2026, 2029 and 2041. Clearly these immigrants are in need and there is a man in a suit already in America with his arms up, showing that there is nothing he can do to help as there is no entry at this time and the country has limited resources and limited housing available. However, we see a large pile of perfectly good food, just going to waste and a large building that is completely vacant and looking for renters. Yet there is a rich man with a bag full of money on his way through the border and his time to be eligible to enter is now, even though the sign says, “No entry right now”. We see Lady Liberty with a calendar in one hand as she represents America setting the wait time on all immigrants trying to enter. This is reflective of how the current immigration laws are not in favor of helping immigrants.

The second float comes around and you see the rich man actually being made to wait outside the border with an eligible time of 2030, to be able to cross the border. This shows how the entry to the country can no longer be bought and reflects immigration law reform. We see the immigrants finally entering the country and lady liberty helping those in need, instead of prioritizing the rich. We see less waste of food and vacant apartments filled with renters.  The focal point is in the second float which shows that the entry is no longer for sale and those in need no longer have an extremely long processing time and the laws are no longer in favor of the rich.
